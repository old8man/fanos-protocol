# FANOS — open tasks

**Only open items live here.** A closed task is deleted, not annotated: its rationale is in the commit that closed it, and any
durable finding belongs in the design or audit doc it concerns (`docs/audit.md`, `docs/design-testing.md`,
`docs/design-anonymity-substrate.md`, `docs/design-coordinates.md`).

**Check the claim before doing the work.** A task list is a cache; this one has gone stale twice. Each item names the file and
symbol its claim rests on so the check is cheap.

No open CRITICAL/HIGH security item remains (`docs/audit.md`, all four passes RESOLVED). What follows are capability,
coherence and quality gaps.

## Tier A — headline frontiers

### 1. OBOLOS diversified / stealth one-time addresses (O-M4)
- **Problem.** The key hierarchy is *half* built. `fanos-obolos/src/wallet.rs` has the full viewing hierarchy —
  `IncomingViewingKey{kem_seed, owner, auth}` with `scan()`, and `to_incoming()` downgrading from the full viewing key —
  so **O-M3 is done** and selective disclosure works. What does **not** exist is the one-time address: `lib.rs:17` and
  `tx.rs:42` both describe stealth addresses as "forthcoming" / "the next increment", and `ring_note.rs:23` notes `rho` is
  the ring-native form of the one-time key a stealth address *would* supply. So two payments to one recipient still reuse
  the same `owner`, and are linkable on-chain before either is spent.
- **Task.** Diversified one-time addresses (ML-KEM-derived per payment) on top of the existing `(ask, ak)` spend-auth and
  the `IncomingViewingKey`, so `scan()` still detects them with no spend authority while distinct payments share no key
  material. Compose with `note`/`nullifier`/`tx`/`note_cipher`/`state` and the §5.D-2 sighash signatures; reconcile the
  three docs above. (The ZK backend stays the separate `[P]` frontier; this is the key structure it inherits.)

### 2. Roster never converges when a coordinate collision has to be resolved
- **Reproduce:** `fanos_sim::fabric` → `measure_roster_convergence_with_collisions_allowed` (`#[ignore]`d; forces a colliding
  draw). Rosters stall (e.g. `[6,4,4,5,5,6,6]`) and `agreed` is `None`; the injective control reaches `[7; 7]` in 24 s.
- **Not the cause** (each measured, do not re-test): placement — trials reach 7 of 7 distinct with nodes visibly advanced along
  their probe walks; claim propagation — 3–7 peers' claims verified per node; the three-valued read fix — already in
  (`Scan<T>`, `role_loop::may_relax`), and it is what made the injective case converge.
- **Not established:** `known_peers` is `Directory::len()` (the dial book, seeded in spawn order — a staircase even when
  converged), so it cannot carry the conclusion. **Prerequisite: an observable meaning "this node can reach coordinate X".**
- `NodeFleet::spawn`'s injective draw stays until a forced-collision run reaches `agreed`.

## Tier B — platform capability

### 4. Settle the default plane order — now constrained by the onion payload floor
- `plane_order` defaults to **2**, where `PG(2,2)` has 4 lines with distinct combiners ⇒ 2 concurrent circuits ⇒ a passive
  adversary's flow-matching floor is **0.50 regardless of the mix schedule** (`8df2b08` made the order selectable and warns on
  under-delivery; the schedule itself is calibrated and closed).
- **New hard constraint:** the fixed-slot onion reserves one nested threshold seal of payload, so circuit depth falls as the
  plane widens — `slots::depth_for`: **3 hops at q=2 and q=3, 2 at q=4, 1 at q=7**. Raising the default to 4 buys a larger
  anonymity set and costs a hop; q=7 cannot carry a circuit at all inside `THRESHOLD_ONION_LEN`.
- **Task:** decide (2, 3 or 4), and if it stays 2 say so in `spec/platform.md` beside the anonymity claim, because
  `--profile anonymous` currently promises more than order 2 delivers. Document per-cell anonymity-set size as first-class
  (absorbs the old item 9). If a wide plane is wanted, `THRESHOLD_ONION_LEN` must grow with it — a wider cell buys more slots,
  not more payload, so the budget is the knob, not the depth.
- Any further timing work must first exhibit a metric an *ideal* mix passes; the previous one penalised conservation and was
  retracted.

## Tier C — coherence & architecture quality

### 7a. Decompose `fanos-runtime/src/overlay/mod.rs`
`overlay.rs` is now `overlay/` (six modules, −28%, zero API change). What remains is `OverlayNode`, its ~1,400-line impl and
`impl Engine`. Natural cuts, each a child module on the pattern `hier` established: `storage`
(`on_put`/`on_get`/`on_sample`/`on_publish`/`on_lookup`/`on_value`/`distribute_shards`), `membership`
(`flood`/`on_join`/`on_announce`/`on_reseat`/epoch), `liveness`
(`on_heartbeat`/`health_view`/`loss_view`/`sweep_pending_gets`). A decision to take deliberately, not to drift into. Method
notes: `docs/design-testing.md` §"Refactoring a large module".

### 8. Coherence / meta-holon reconciliation (E→L / L→O / Ω2 / Ω9)
- **Problem.** The cross-block coherence contracts (`platform.md §1.2`, §9) are asserted but not reconciled in one place:
  the per-subsystem aspect budgets (Ω2 — every tier names all seven aspects), the CALM class on each consistency contract
  (Ω9), and the E→L / L→O typed channels. Also "stake read literally" (§1.2 L→O) versus the historical "forbids capital
  staking" (§7), now that bonded stake exists.
- **Task.** Produce the declared budget/contract table and reconcile it against `fanos-holarch::instance::fanos_platform`
  — which already encodes a budget set and is what the gate scores, so any table that disagrees with it is a real
  divergence, not a documentation gap. Reconcile the staking framing against the shipped `StakeLedger`; add
  `SUBJECT_DEPTH_MAX` / CALM annotations where a live enforcement point exists.
