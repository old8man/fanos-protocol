//! The **shield bridge** — moving public token value into the private OBOLOS pool (`spec/platform.md` §4, the
//! transparent↔shielded seam). Shielding lets a holder of public funds acquire privacy on demand: a signed
//! transfer moves `amount` from the shielder to a keyless **pool sink** (whose balance is the public, auditable
//! total backing the shielded pool — an invariant maintained by construction: it equals the sum of all unspent
//! shielded note values), and a note of that value is minted into the pool.
//!
//! A shield reveals the *entry* — the amount and the note's opening are public at the boundary (like Zcash's
//! transparent→shielded direction, which reveals the shielded amount). Privacy begins at the **first shielded
//! transfer**: from then on the value moves under hidden commitments and unlinkable nullifiers. The reverse
//! direction (unshield: spend a note, reveal its value, credit a transparent account, debit the pool sink)
//! composes on top — it needs a shielded spend that reveals a public output, an extension of the OBOLOS proof.
