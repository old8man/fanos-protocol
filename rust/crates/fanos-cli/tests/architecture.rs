//! This exists because the prose form of the claim rotted twice inside one audit. It was written as "34 of
//! 43 crates are reachable from the shipped node", with `fanos-holarch` and `fanos-observatory` listed as
//! "not in the binary at all" — both own or are linked by shipped binaries — and with six crates listed as
//! "never exercised over any transport", of which three (`fanos-session`, `fanos-stream`,
//! `fanos-threshold`) are reached through `fanos-diaulos` / `fanos-aphantos` by the real-QUIC suites. Every
//! one of those errors came from grepping for a crate's *name* where it is used through an intermediary.
//! A closure computed over the manifests cannot make that mistake, and a test cannot go stale quietly.
