//! # fanos-rendezvous — anonymous meeting for DIAULOS
//!
//! A `.fanos` session normally rides the base overlay by coordinate (the Direct profile), which
//! reveals *where* each party is. The anonymous profile instead carries the very same DIAULOS
//! payloads (the `ClientHello`/`ServerHello` and the sealed cells) over **threshold onions**
//! ([`fanos_aphantos`], "a hop is a line") to a **computed meeting line** ([`meeting_line`], derived
//! by CALYPSO from the service key and the epoch — no lookup, rotates each epoch). Because aphantos
//! onions are forward-only, the two directions are two independent forward circuits that meet at
//! rendezvous lines:
//!
//! * client → service: an onion whose last hop is the service's meeting line;
//! * service → client: an onion whose last hop is a *client-chosen* reply rendezvous line, which the
//!   client names (with an ephemeral reply key) inside its first message.
//!
//! So neither party learns the other's location — each is reachable only at a rotating rendezvous
//! line, through `t`-of-`(q+1)` threshold hops no single node can peel. This crate is the sealing and
//! meeting-line core; wiring it under a DIAULOS session's payload API is a thin layer above.
