//! A Control-Barrier-Function (CBF) safety seam for the coherence homeostat (frontier candidate 2).
//!
//! The homeostat's action authority is a *learnable* seam — a future SYNARC policy chooses the
//! regeneration control `κ`. To guarantee that **no** learned or adversarial choice can ever push the cell
//! out of viability, every proposed control is filtered through a **control barrier function** (Ames et
//! al., *Control Barrier Functions*, arXiv:1609.06408; Kolathaya–Ames, *ISSf-CBF*, arXiv:1803.03035).
//!
//! Take the barrier `h(P) = P − 2/N`, so the safe set `{h ≥ 0}` is exactly the viability region `𝒱`
//! (T-104). An action keeps the state in `𝒱` for all time iff it satisfies `ḣ + γ·h ≥ 0` (forward
//! invariance, `γ > 0`). For the reduced purity dynamics `dP/dτ = drift + control_gain·κ` (see
//! [`PurityDynamics::barrier_coeffs`](crate::dynamics::PurityDynamics::barrier_coeffs)) this is **one
//! linear inequality in the scalar `κ`**, so the CBF quadratic program `min‖κ − κ_prop‖² s.t. …` collapses
//! to a closed form: the minimal correction of the proposal that holds the barrier.
//!
//! Two facts make this the right envelope for the reflex/learnable seam (`synarc-node-architecture`):
//! * **It provably contains `{P ≥ 2/N}`.** Every proposal — including an adversary's `κ = 0` — is raised
//!   to the least `κ` that satisfies the barrier, so the cell never crosses `∂𝒱` while the CBF is
//!   feasible. A SYNARC policy is free *within* this envelope and safe *at its edge* — this is what makes
//!   the learnable layer unable to break safety, no matter what it learns.
//! * **It recovers escalation exactly.** At the boundary the V-gate `g_V(P) → 0`, so `control_gain → 0`
//!   and the minimal safe control → ∞: no admissible `κ` can hold the barrier, and the filter returns
//!   [`SafeControl::Escalate`] — precisely the corpus "point of no return without external help"
//!   (T-104 §5). The escalation boundary is thus **derived from feasibility**, not hand-set.
